{"title": "Digit factorial chains", "body": "<div class=\"problem_content\" role=\"problem\">\n<p>The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to 145:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:50px;\">1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145</p>\n<p>Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:50px;\">169 \u2192 363601 \u2192 1454 \u2192 169<br/>\n871 \u2192 45361 \u2192 871<br/>\n872 \u2192 45362 \u2192 872</p>\n<p>It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:50px;\">69 \u2192 363600 \u2192 1454 \u2192 169 \u2192 363601 (\u2192 1454)<br/>\n78 \u2192 45360 \u2192 871 \u2192 45361 (\u2192 871)<br/>\n540 \u2192 145 (\u2192 145)</p>\n<p>Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.</p>\n<p>How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?</p>\n</div>"}

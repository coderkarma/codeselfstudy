One of the possible chains is shown below:<br/>\n2 \u2194 3 \u2194 13 \u2194 113 \u2194 103 \u2194 107 \u2194 127<br/>\nHowever, 11 and 103 are not 2's relatives.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet F(N) be the sum of the primes \u2264 N which are not 2's relatives.<br/>\nWe can verify that F(10<sup>3</sup>) = 431 and F(10<sup>4</sup>) = 78728.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind F(10<sup>7</sup>).\n</p>\n</div>"

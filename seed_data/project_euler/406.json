{"title": "Guessing Game", "body": "<div class=\"problem_content\" role=\"problem\">\n<p>We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2, ..., <var>n</var>} by asking questions. \nEach number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers:<br/></p><ul><li> \"Your guess is lower than the hidden number\" (and you incur a cost of <var>a</var>), or</li>\n<li> \"Your guess is higher than the hidden number\" (and you incur a cost of <var>b</var>), or</li>\n<li> \"Yes, that's it!\" (and the game ends).</li>\n</ul><p>Given the value of <var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, and <var>b</var>, an <i>optimal strategy</i> minimizes the total cost <u>for the worst possible case</u>.</p>\n<p>For example, if <var>n</var> = 5, <var>a</var> = 2, and <var>b</var> = 3, then we may begin by asking \"<b>2</b>\" as our first question.</p>\n<p>If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>b</var>=3), then we are sure that \"<b>1</b>\" is the hidden number (for a total cost of <span style=\"color:#0000FF;\"><b>3</b></span>).<br/>\nIf we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>a</var>=2), then our next question will be \"<b>4</b>\".<br/>\nIf we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>b</var>=3), then we are sure that \"<b>3</b>\" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=<span style=\"color:#0000FF;\"><b>5</b></span>).<br/>\nIf we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>a</var>=2), then we are sure that \"<b>5</b>\" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=<span style=\"color:#0000FF;\"><b>4</b></span>).<br/>\nThus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\"><b>5</b></span>. It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. \nSo, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of <var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, and <var>b</var>.</p>\n<p>Let C(<var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for the given values of <var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, and <var>b</var>.</p>\n<p>Here are a few examples:<br/>\nC(5, 2, 3) = 5<br/>\nC(500, \u221a2, \u221a3) = 13.22073197...<br/>\nC(20000, 5, 7) = 82<br/>\nC(2000000, \u221a5, \u221a7) = 49.63755955...</p>\n<p>Let F<sub><var>k</var></sub> be the Fibonacci numbers: F<sub><var>k</var></sub> = F<sub><var>k</var>-1</sub> + F<sub><var>k</var>-2</sub> with base cases F<sub>1</sub> = F<sub>2</sub> = 1.<br/>Find \u2211<sub>1\u2264<var>k</var>\u226430</sub>\u00a0C(10<sup>12</sup>, \u221a<var>k</var>, \u221aF<sub><var>k</var></sub>), and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.</p>\n</div>"}

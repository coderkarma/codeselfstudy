{"body":"\r\nThe Torpids are rowing races held annually in Oxford, following some curious rules:\n\n<ul><li>\nA division consists of $n$ boats (typically 13), placed in order based on past performance.\n</li><li>\nAll boats within a division start at 40 metre intervals along the river, in order with the highest-placed boat starting furthest upstream.\n</li><li>\nThe boats all start rowing simultaneously, upstream, trying to catch the boat in front while avoiding being caught by boats behind.\n</li><li>\nEach boat continues rowing until <em>either</em> it reaches the finish line <em>or</em> it catches up with (&quot;bumps&quot;) a boat in front.\n</li><li>\nThe finish line is a distance $L$ metres (the course length, in reality about 1800 metres) upstream from the starting position of the lowest-placed boat. (Because of the staggered starting positions, higher-placed boats row a slightly shorter course than lower-placed boats.)\n</li><li>\nWhen a &quot;bump&quot; occurs, the &quot;bumping&quot; boat takes no further part in the race. The &quot;bumped&quot; boat must continue, however, and may even be &quot;bumped&quot; again by boats that started two or more places behind it.\n</li><li>\nAfter the race, boats are assigned new places within the division, based on the bumps that occurred. Specifically, for any boat $A$ that started in a lower place than $B$, then $A$ will be placed higher than $B$ in the new order if and only if one of the following occurred:\n  <ol><li> $A$ bumped $B$ directly </li><li> $A$ bumped another boat that went on to bump $B$ </li><li> $A$ bumped another boat, that bumped yet another boat, that bumped $B$ </li><li> etc </li></ol></li></ul><b>NOTE</b>: For the purposes of this problem you may disregard the boats&apos; lengths, and assume that a bump occurs precisely when the two boats draw level. (In reality, a bump is awarded as soon as physical contact is made, which usually occurs when there is much less than a full boat length&apos;s overlap.)\n\n<p>\nSuppose that, in a particular race, each boat $B_j$ rows at a steady speed $v_j = -$log$X_j$ metres per second, where the $X_j$ are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) between 0 and 1, independently from one another. These speeds are relative to the riverbank: you may disregard the flow of the river.\n</p><p>\nLet $p(n,L)$ be the probability that the new order is an <b>even permutation</b> of the starting order, when there are $n$ boats in the division and $L$ is the course length.\n</p><p>\nFor example, with $n=3$ and $L=160$, labelling the boats as $A$,$B$,$C$ in starting order with $C$ highest, the different possible outcomes of the race are as follows:\n</p><table cellspacing=\"15\" align=\"center\"><tr><th> Bumps occurring </th><th> New order </th><th> Permutation </th><th> Probability </th></tr><tr align=\"center\"><td> none </td><td> $A$, $B$, $C$ </td><td> even </td><td> $4/15$ </td></tr><tr align=\"center\"><td> $B$ bumps $C$ </td><td> $A$, $C$, $B$ </td><td> odd </td><td> $8/45$ </td></tr><tr align=\"center\"><td> $A$ bumps $B$ </td><td> $B$, $A$, $C$ </td><td> odd </td><td> $1/3$ </td></tr><tr align=\"center\"><td>     $B$ bumps $C$, then $A$ bumps $C$     </td><td> $C$, $A$, $B$ </td><td> even </td><td> $4/27$ </td></tr><tr align=\"center\"><td>     $A$ bumps $B$, then $B$ bumps $C$     </td><td> $C$, $B$, $A$ </td><td> odd </td><td> $2/27$ </td></tr></table><p>\nTherefore, $p(3,160) = 4/15 + 4/27 = 56/135$.\n</p><p>\nYou are also given that $p(4,400)=0.5107843137$, rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.\n</p><p>\nFind $p(13,1800)$ rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.\n</p>","id":"597","title":"Torpids","url":"https://projecteuler.net/problem=597"}

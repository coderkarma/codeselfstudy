Its grid spacing is 1.<br/>\nWhen we cut the sheet along the grid lines into two pieces and rearrange those pieces without overlap, we can make new rectangles with different dimensions.</p>\n<p>For example, from a sheet with dimensions 9 \u00d7 4 , we can make rectangles with dimensions 18 \u00d7 2, 12 \u00d7 3 and 6 \u00d7 6 by cutting and rearranging as below:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img alt=\"p338_gridpaper.gif\" src=\"project/images/p338_gridpaper.gif\"/><br/></div>\n<p>Similarly, from a sheet with dimensions 9 \u00d7 8 , we can make rectangles with dimensions 18 \u00d7 4 and 12 \u00d7 6 .</p>\n<p>For a pair <var>w</var> and <var>h</var>, let F(<var>w</var>,<var>h</var>) be the number of distinct rectangles that can be made from a sheet with dimensions <var>w</var> \u00d7 <var>h</var> .<br/>\nFor example, F(2,1) = 0, F(2,2) = 1, F(9,4) = 3 and F(9,8) = 2. <br/>\nNote that rectangles congruent to the initial one are not counted in F(<var>w</var>,<var>h</var>).<br/>\nNote also that rectangles with dimensions <var>w</var> \u00d7 <var>h</var> and dimensions <var>h</var> \u00d7 <var>w</var> are not considered distinct.</p>\n<p>For an integer <var>N</var>, let G(<var>N</var>) be the sum of F(<var>w</var>,<var>h</var>) for all pairs <var>w</var> and <var>h</var> which satisfy 0 &lt; <var>h</var> \u2264 <var>w</var> \u2264 <var>N</var>.<br/>\nWe can verify that G(10) = 55, G(10<sup>3</sup>) = 971745 and G(10<sup>5</sup>) = 9992617687.</p>\n<p>Find G(10<sup>12</sup>).

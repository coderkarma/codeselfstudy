Mazes which can be formed by rotation and reflection from another maze are considered distinct.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt can be verified that C(1,1) = 1, C(2,2) = 4, C(3,4) = 2415, and C(9,12) = 2.5720e46 (in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits).<br/>\nFind C(100,500) and write your answer in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen giving your answer, use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent.\nE.g. if the answer is 1234567891011 then the answer format would be 1.2346e12.\n\n</p>\n</div>"

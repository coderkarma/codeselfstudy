{"title": "Stone Game II", "body": "<div class=\"problem_content\" role=\"problem\">\n<p>\nA game is played with two piles of stones and two players. At her turn, a player removes a number of stones from the larger pile. The number of stones she removes must be a positive multiple of the number of stones in the smaller pile.\n</p>\n<p>\nE.g., let the ordered pair(6,14) describe a configuration with 6 stones in the smaller pile and 14 stones in the larger pile, then the first player can remove 6 or 12 stones from the larger pile.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe player taking all the stones from a pile wins the game.\n</p>\n<p>\nA <i>winning configuration</i> is one where the first player can force a win. For example, (1,5), (2,6) and (3,12) are winning configurations because the first player can immediately remove all stones in the second pile.\n</p>\n<p>\nA <i>losing configuration</i> is one where the second player can force a win, no matter what the first player does. For example, (2,3) and (3,4) are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.\n</p>\n<p>\nDefine S(<var>N</var>) as the sum of (<var>x</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>+<var>y</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>) for all losing configurations (<var>x</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>,<var>y</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>), 0 &lt; <var>x</var><sub><var>i</var></sub> &lt; <var>y</var><sub><var>i</var></sub> \u2264 <var>N</var>. We can verify that S(10) = 211 and S(10<sup>4</sup>) = 230312207313.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind S(10<sup>16</sup>) mod 7<sup>10</sup>.\n</p>\n</div>"}
